= http://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts[Hawkular Charting Directives]

This project provides AngularJS directives for displaying custom visual representations of time series data as charts.
It uses http://d3js.org[D3] as its charting toolkit and tries to simplify creating advanced metrics visualizations
with Angular.js.

== About

Hawkular Charts is a direct result of wanting metric visualizations for the parent project:
http://github.com/hawkular/hawkular[Hawkular] - _An Open Source
Monitoring Tool_. The console in Hawkular uses these charting components and will further push the development
of these charting components into the future with additional features and specialized chart types.
This will also make adhoc development quicker/easier with components that can render Hawkular Metrics charts with very
little effort.

== Charts

==== Metrics Chart Type
image::img/hawkular-metric-charts.png[Hawkular Metrics Chart Type]

_Sample code for this chart:_

[source,javascript]
----
<hawkular-chart
    data="{{dataPoints}}"
    chart-type="hawkularmetric"
    alert-value="{{threshold}}"
    y-axis-units="Response Time (ms)"
    chart-height="250">
</hawkular-chart>
----
Want to update the chart, no problem, just alter the dataPoints array with new data and the chart will re-render itself.
Through custom attributes it is very easy to configure a custom chart just the way you want using advanced
capabilities that standard charting libraries don't provide.
Need to change the threshold alert value or chart-type just use Angular's two way binding to bind to a field on the
screen and watch the dynamics unfold.

Explore an actual implementation in Hawkular Console: https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular/blob/master/ui/console/src/main/scripts/plugins/metrics/plugins/metrics/html/response-time.html[here]

==== Availability Chart Type
image::img/avail-chart.png[Hawkular Availability Chart Type]

_Sample code for this chart:_

[source,javascript]
----
<availability-chart
    data="{{vm.availabilityDataPoints}}"
    chart-type="availability">
</availability-chart>

----
The availability chart makes it easy to visualize the availability types:

* up
* down
* unknown (no data was collected for this time period, so we don't know if it was up or down)

on a time line.
Hovering over one of the areas provides additional information such as: when the period started/ended, the duration
of the period and the status of the period.


==== Other Chart Types
Here is an screen shot from the Hawkular Console that uses the multi-line chart for displaying JVM metrics:

Don't like the charts we have? Take one of the existing charts and modify (there are many types in the code).

== How to Get

        bower install hawkular-charts --save

Or

*Download:* http://rawgit.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/master/hawkular-charts.js[hawkular-charts.js]

== Using the Charting Directives
Bind to a javascript array of metrics:

[source,javascript]
----
 <hawkular-chart
     data="{{vm.getChartDataFor(selectedMetric)}}"
     chart-type="{{selectedChart.chartType}}"
     chart-height="250">
 </hawkular-chart>
----

The nice part of about using angular in the charting framework is that whenever the underlying data changes, watchers automatically load and re-render the chart (as well as any of the properties that may have changed like chart-type).
This results in less code and more productivity.

.Prerequisite setup:
. Add the hawkular-charts.css to the main index.html page
. Add the hawkular-charts.js to the main index.html page
. Add the charting module to the application module: `app.module('myApp', ['hawkular.charts']);`

All that's left to do now is select the chart type and bind the _data_ attribute on the __<hawkular-chart>__ directive.


=== Stand Alone Live Updating Tag Example
__Quickly and easily add some dynamically updating charts to your own pages__


The stand alone version of the tag allows for linking to hawkular-metrics servers (or any supplier of formatted metric data) without any dependencies except for a few js libs and 2 lines of script to setup an Angular app.

[source,javascript]
----
<hawkular-chart
        chart-type="bar"
        metric-id="server2.cpu.user"
        metric-url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/hawkular/metrics"
        time-range-in-seconds="86400002"
        refresh-interval-in-seconds="30"
        chart-height="250" >
</hawkular-chart>
----

This allows plain html web pages to be sprinkled with tags and a couple js libs and you can have dynamic live updating metrics. Great for NOCs or dashboards. These pages can even be emailed around and then thrown behind an http server for viewing.

*Sample Stand Alone Example Page:*  https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/blob/master/stand-alone-chart-sample.html[stand-alone-chart-sample.html]
This allows dashboard templates to be emailed around (although they need to be rendered behind a http server of your choice).


== Chart Customization

.This project is built around customization. There are several forms of customization:
- Most cosmetic issues are controlled via standard css through the http://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/blob/master/css/hawkular-charts.css[hawkular-charts.css].
- Additional(new) functionality is offered through custom attributes.


== Building the Project

.You have to install required software before you're able to use grunt to build:
* Install _Node.js_ - Find more information on http://nodejs.org/[Node.js]
** Install _npm_ - If npm is not already installed with Node.js, you have to install it manually. Find more information on https://www.npmjs.org/[npm]
* Install _Gulp_ and _Bower_ globally:   `npm install -g bower gulp`
* Install _npm_ dependencies with:  `npm install`
* Install _bower_ dependencies with:  `bower install`

The environment is now ready to be built.

The *Hawkular Charts*  directives can be built with: `gulp build`. Or, for dev build that updates with every
change: `gulp watch`

The resulting javascript file is placed in the root directory as _hawkular-charts.js_

== Examples

To run the examples, start an http server from the _hawkular-charts_ root directory (such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 .`)

* http://rawgit.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/master/metrics-chart-sample.html.js[Metric Chart]
* http://rawgit.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/master/multi-chart-sample.html.js[Multi-line Chart]
* http://rawgit.com/hawkular/hawkular-charts/master/avail-test.html.js[Availability Chart]


== Consuming Hawkular Charts from Hawkular Project

Easily setup bower linking so that changes to the charts are instantly reflected in Hawkular console...
